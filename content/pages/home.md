## About me <small>NHS Head of Digital Delivery and Undegraduate Supervisor</small>

### üë®‚Äçüíª Digital Specialist
I'm a broad based digital specialist with a special interest in healthcare and government technology. This has included roles as a product owner, technical business analyst and user researcher (and even a short stint as a junior full-stack developer).

I am currently Head of Digital Delivery for [NHS Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West ICB](https://www.bucksoxonberksw.icb.nhs.uk/) where I lead on delivery of digital projects to improve integration across the region. Before this I worked over at [The PSC Digital](https://thepsc.co.uk/digital) where I helped to deliver impactful digital solutions for public services.

### üë®‚Äçüè´ Academia
As of the 2023/24 academic year I supervise [Software and Security Engineering](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2223/SWSecEng/) at the University of Cambridge. I have also previously supervised [Object Oriented Programming](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2223/OOProg/) (22/23) and [Operating Systems](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2223/OpSystems/) (22/23). If you're my supervisee and you're looking for your work - it's not here it's on Google Classroom!

Before supervising I honed my teaching skills at the University of Reading where I completed a PGCE (with QTS) in Secondary Computer Science teaching. My technical background comes from University of Cambridge (Homerton College) where I graduated with a first class BA in Computer Science. Whilst there I was the Vice-President External on the Homerton Union of Students and spent most of my time campaigning on the [bus](https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/19253) [issue](https://thetab.com/uk/cambridge/2020/05/19/girton-is-finally-on-the-map-but-homerton-and-wolfson-still-arent-problems-with-the-new-u-bus-plans-137652) ([again](https://thetab.com/uk/cambridge/2020/01/14/university-bus-service-currently-failing-disabled-students-at-girton-and-homerton-129885) and [again](https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/18903) and ...).
