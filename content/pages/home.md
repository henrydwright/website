## About me <small>Former Computer Science Student and Teacher</small>

I have just finished my PGCE at the University of Reading where I trained to become a secondary school Computer Science teacher. I achieved an average mark of 83/100 in my PGCE and finished with an Excellent (1) in my final QTS report.

Before this I studied at the University of Cambridge (Homerton College) where I graduated with a first class BA in Computer Science. Whilst there I was the Vice-President External on the Homerton Union of Students and spent most of my time campaigning on the [bus](https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/19253) [issue](https://thetab.com/uk/cambridge/2020/05/19/girton-is-finally-on-the-map-but-homerton-and-wolfson-still-arent-problems-with-the-new-u-bus-plans-137652) ([again](https://thetab.com/uk/cambridge/2020/01/14/university-bus-service-currently-failing-disabled-students-at-girton-and-homerton-129885) and [again](https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/18903) and ...).

Previously, I attended The Willink School where I was head boy from 2016 to 2017 and obtained A*A*A*A grades in my A-Levels in Maths, Further Maths, Physics and German. I also briefly ran a small computer repair business called Wright Fix Repairs.
